  Feature engineering: |-
    Action: Feature engineering
    
    Description: We engineer the features for the sake of best model performance on the basis of engineering the most influential features.
    
    1. Type of Feature and Data Characteristics:
      - Clearly define the type of feature being introduced.
      - Explain what data characteristics or patterns this feature captures.
      - Keep descriptions focused, avoiding redundant details to ensure clarity.

    2. Simple and Effective Features First:
      - Start by introducing features that are simple yet likely to be effective.
      - Provide a concise explanation of why these features are expected to perform well.
      - Avoid complex or combined features during the initial stages.
    
    3. Gradual Complexity Increase:
      - After initial feature testing, introduce more complex features.
      - Discuss both the potential benefits and any additional complexities of these features.
      - Begin combining features only after simpler ones have been tested and validated.

    4. New Directions and Optimizations:
      - If results suggest a need for a new approach, explain why, using data analysis, domain knowledge, or observed patterns.
      - Propose one new direction per iteration for clarity and focus.
      - If a previous hypothesis did not surpass the previous best but shows promise, continue in the same direction with optimizations.
      - Emphasize that features that outperform previous best results are added to the feature library, avoiding redundant work.
      
    5. 1-3 Feature Tasks per Generation:
      - Each generation should produce 1-3 feature tasks.
      - Maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity to develop a diverse and robust feature library.

  Feature processing: |-
    Action: Feature processing
    
    1. Feature Transformation and Normalization:
      - Clearly define any transformations applied to features (e.g., scaling, normalization, log transforms).
      - Explain how these transformations improve the data's suitability for the model.
      - Ensure transformations do not introduce unnecessary complexity early on.
    
    2. Handling Missing Values and Outliers:
      - Define any imputation methods used for missing data (e.g., mean, median, or more complex methods).
      - Explain how outliers are handled (e.g., clipping, removal, or transformation).
      - Ensure these processes are straightforward, enhancing data quality without overcomplicating early feature processing.
    
    3. Feature Interactions and Combinations:
      - After testing individual features, introduce combinations or interactions.
      - Discuss the potential advantages of feature interaction terms (e.g., polynomial or multiplicative features).
      - Ensure interactions are only applied after simpler, individual features have been processed.

    4. 1-3 Feature Tasks per Generation:
      - Each generation should produce 1-3 feature tasks.
      - Maintain a balance between simplicity and complexity to develop a diverse and robust feature library.

  Model feature selection: |-
    Selection_based_on_model_type:
      - Specify which features are being selected and explain why, considering the model type (e.g., NN, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost).
      - Ensure the relationship between features and the model type is well-defined, as different features perform better on different models.
    Pattern_recognition:
      - Explain the data characteristics or patterns that influenced feature selection for the specific model.
      - Clarify how the selected features complement the model's strengths and handle its potential weaknesses.

  Model tuning: |-
      Explain the hypothesis clearly with valuable information. What kind of model are you building/tuning? What do you think is true? How are you revising and why? What are some innovations? Base your hypothesis on the previous history and your understanding of the model code. "Tune" means changing the model architecture or hyperparameters. 
      Focus_on_architecture_or_hyper_parameter_tuning_or_both:
        - Focus on designing new model architectures one at a time OR hyper-parameter tuning OR both.
        - Each hypothesis should introduce a novel architecture or a significant modification to an existing one, while leveraging previous experiences and the hypothesis history.
        - Optimize one model at a time, iterating until its potential is fully explored. Switch to a new model only when you believe the current modelâ€™s potential has been exhausted.       
      Specific_to_model_type:
        - Note that any types of tuning or model design must be specific to the model types available in our workspace.
        - Clearly define the model type (e.g., Neural Network Models (MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU etc.), XGBoost, RandomForest, LightGBM) and the architecture/tuning being introduced.
        - Ensure the architecture or tuning aligns with the data characteristics and the strengths or limitations of the specific model. 
      Rationale_behind_architecture_and_tuning:
        - Explain the innovation or reasoning behind the architectural design or tuning approach.
        - Justify how the new structure or parameter change captures data patterns more effectively, improves learning efficiency, or enhances predictive power.      
      Start_simple_innovate_gradually:
        - Start with innovative yet simple changes to ensure each iteration is well-tested and the results are well-understood.
        - Gradually introduce more complex architectural changes or hyper-parameter adjustments based on gathered results and insights.
      Introduce_one_innovation_at_a_time:
        - Focus on testing one key innovation at a time to isolate its impact on performance.
        - Avoid combining multiple innovations in a single iteration to maintain clarity in performance results.
      Hypothesis_statement:
        - For each hypothesis, specify the exact innovation or tuning approach and explain why it's expected to enhance performance for the chosen model type. Eg. Instead of a general "Adjusting", specific the direction & extent. 
      Hypothesis_examples: (Please note that they are only examples)
        1. "Increasing the dropout rate in an MLP from 0.2 to 0.5 will help reduce overfitting and improve model generalization on validation data."
        2. "Adding a skip connection to the CNN architecture will allow deeper layers to receive gradients more effectively, preventing vanishing gradients and improving feature learning."
        3. "Doubling the GRU hidden units from 128 to 256 will allow the model to capture more complex temporal dependencies in time-series data, potentially improving accuracy."
        4. "Switching the LSTM optimizer from Adam to SGD with momentum will slow down convergence, leading to more stable and refined learning over time in sparse data environments."
        5. "Reducing the learning rate in a LightGBM model from 0.05 to 0.01 will slow down the learning process, allowing for better generalization on larger datasets."
        6. "Incorporating a self-attention layer into the RNN model will enhance its ability to focus on important parts of the input sequence, improving sequence-to-sequence translation accuracy."
        7. "Increasing the maximum depth of trees in a RandomForest model from 10 to 20 will allow the model to capture more complex patterns in high-dimensional data, improving performance."
        8. "Replacing the ReLU activation with Leaky ReLU in a CNN will prevent the dying ReLU problem and improve the modelâ€™s ability to learn from negative values."
        9. "Introducing early stopping in XGBoost with a patience of 10 rounds will prevent overfitting by halting training when the validation error no longer improves."
        10. "Expanding the CNN kernel size from 3x3 to 5x5 in early layers will help capture larger spatial dependencies in image data, enhancing performance on image classification tasks."

model_experiment_output_format: |-
  According to the hypothesis, please help user design one model task.
  We only build one model from four main model types: ["XGBoost", "RandomForest", "LightGBM", "NN"].
  The output should follow JSON format which can be processed by json.load(). The schema is as follows: 
  {
      "model_name": "model_name",
      "description": "A detailed description of the model",
      "architecture": "A detailed description of the model's architecture, e.g., neural network layers or tree structures",

      },
      "model_type": "Please select only **one** model type from the following four options: XGBoost, RandomForest, LightGBM, or NN. The selected model must be unique and used as the **primary model**. You may choose an auxiliary model for support or optimization on specific tasks if necessary, but the primary model must come from the provided options."

  }
  Usually, a larger model works better than a smaller one. Hence, the parameters should be larger.

model_tuning_feedback_generation:
  system: |-
    You are an advanced assistant for analyzing results in data-driven R&D, in the context of designing machine learning models.
    The task is described in the following scenario:
    {{ scenario }}

    You will analyze the current experiment's hypothesis, model tuning code, results, and compare them with previous experiments and the best past result. 
    Your feedback should:
    1. Confirm if the current result supports or refutes the hypothesis.
    2. Compare with previous best results.
    3. Suggest improvements or new directions. Stay innovative and adapative.

    Please provide detailed and constructive feedback. Note that as hypothesis evolve, a general trend should be that the model grows larger. 
    Example JSON Structure for Result Analysis, without "```json" or prefix or postfix:
    {
      "Observations": "Your overall observations here",
      "Feedback for Hypothesis": "Observations related to the hypothesis",
      "New Hypothesis": "Your new hypothesis here",
      "Reasoning": "Reasoning for the new hypothesis",
      "Replace Best Result": "yes or no"
    }

    Hypothesis Evolution Logic:
    - If the current hypothesis works, make the model more complex (e.g., add layers, neurons, etc.).
    - If a hypothesis works, build on it. If not, adjust at the same level before growing deeper. Think step by step and make changes. Act innovatively. 
    - If it doesn't, modify elements at the current level (e.g., adjust regularization, change features).

    Example Hypothesis Evolution Stages: (We want hypotheses to continue growing.) Levels include **Model Type**, **Layer Configuration**, **Activation Functions**, **Regularization Techniques**, **Feature Selection Methods**...
      - Initial Hypothesis: Use CNN with no feature selection.
      - Next Level (if successful): Add 5 convolutional layers, use all features.
      - Modify (if unsuccessful): Use 3 convolutional layers, add L1 regularization for feature selection.
      - Continue Growth (if successful): Add Leaky ReLU activation to all layers, retain L1-selected features.
      - Further Growth (if successful): Add dropout regularization (0.5 rate), retain L1 features.
      - Adjust (if unsuccessful): Use 5 layers, Leaky ReLU, dropout 0.3 rate.

    You are a professional data feature engineering assistant in data-driven R&D. 
    The task is described in the following scenario:
    {{ scenario }}
    
    You will receive a hypothesis, multiple tasks with their features, their results, and the best previous result. 
    Your feedback should specify whether the current result supports or refutes the hypothesis, compare it with previous best results, and suggest improvements or new directions.
    
    Please understand the following operation logic and then make your feedback suitable for the scenario:
      1. Logic Explanation:
          - If the previous hypothesis feature surpasses the previous best, include this feature in the feature library.
          - New experiments will generate new features, which will be combined with the features in the library.
          - These combined features will be evaluated and compared against the current best to continuously iterate.
      2. Development Directions:
          - New Direction:
              - Propose a new feature direction for exploration and development.
          - Optimization of Existing Direction:
              - If the previous experiment's feature replaced the best, suggest further improvements to that feature.
              - Clearly specify the differences in name and improvements compared to the previous feature.
          - Continued Research:
              - If the previous experiment's feature did not replace the best, suggest ways to optimize and develop features in this direction.
      3. Final Goal:
          - The ultimate goal is to continuously accumulate features that surpass each iteration to maintain the best results.
    
    Consider Changing Direction for Significant Gaps with the Best Result:
      - If the new results significantly differ from the best result, consider exploring a new direction.
      - Avoid re-implementing previous features as those that surpassed the best are already included in the feature library and will be used in each run.
    Please provide detailed and constructive feedback for future exploration.
